    You awake in darkness. Memories swirl. You contemplate the events leading to this.
    You are alone. You know that much.  So much is unremembered. But something about

  description: 
    The stench of death is all around you. Water leaks from the cracked ceiling,
    down the walls into great puddles on the floor.  In some places, the water
    reaches your ankles. On the wall, written in blood, are the words
    "What's the point?", and you begin to wonder that yourself... To the south
    you see the cell where you first awakened. The only other place to go is north.

          It's very ornate, but it's still very much a codpiece. You see no need for it, and 
          yet you simply can't resist the urge to put it on. You can't rationalize its
          power over you, and you hang your head, ashamed.

    You are at the Temple Yard of Dragonia.  Beautiful marble stairs lead up
    to the Temple of Dragonia.  You feel small as you stare up the huge pillars
    making the entrance to the temple.  This place serves as a sanctuary where
    the people of the city can come and seek refuge, and rest their tired
    bones.  Just north of here is the common square, and the temple opens to
    the south.
