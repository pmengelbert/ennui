# Check out the demo
There's a live demo running at [ennuimud.org](https://ennuimud.org). Log in, wander around for a while :)

The order of operations is always action -> object -> indirect object (i.e. 'give key cat' will give the key to the cat).

Full command list:

```
look,
take,
get,
wear,
remove,
drop,
give,
say,
chat,
evaluate, // i.e. show your stats
open,
unlock,
hit,
sleep,
wake,
stand,
north,
south,
east,
west,
inventory,
quit
```
