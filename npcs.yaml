  description:
    With the gaze and ferocity of a panther, Mitchell the cat is as Rilke describes--


    Only at times the pupil’s curtain slides

    up soundlessly — . An image enters then,

    goes through the tensioned stillness of the limbs —

    and in the heart ceases to be.


  display:
    Short, dark and handsome, Mitchell the cat is here.
